# shoreline_resource (Resource)

[Resources](https://docs.shoreline.io/platform/resources) are the infrastructure objects managed by Shoreline.  A [Resources](https://docs.shoreline.io/platform/resources) refers to a specific host, pod, or container throughout the Shoreline platform. It may also refer to a more distinct entity, such as a virtual machine or a database instance.

[Resources](https://docs.shoreline.io/platform/resources) types are platform and provider agnostic. So whether it's a fleet of pods and containers in Kubernetes, stand-alone hosts, or many virtual machines, Shoreline can control those [Resourcess](https://docs.shoreline.io/platform/resources) within AWS, GCP, or Azure.

-> Shoreline [Resources](https://docs.shoreline.io/platform/resources) are not to be confused with [Terraform resources](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/resources/index.html).

## Required Properties

- name - A unique name for the [Resource](https://docs.shoreline.io/platform/resources) resource.
- value - A valid [Op](https://docs.shoreline.io/op) statement that defines a valid [Resource query](https://docs.shoreline.io/platform/resources).

## Usage

Shoreline [Resources](https://docs.shoreline.io/platform/resources) are effectively aliases for more complex [Resource queries](https://docs.shoreline.io/platform/resources).  For example, the following definition creates a custom [Resource](https://docs.shoreline.io/platform/resources) called `az_k8s` as an alias for the full query to target Kubernetes pods on Azure:

```tf
resource "shoreline_resource" "az_k8s" {
  name        = "${var.namespace}_az_k8s"
  value       = "hosts | k8s=true | cloud_provider='azure' | pods | namespace=[\"${var.namespace}\"]"
  description = "All Shoreline Kubernetes pods on Azure"
}
```

-> See the Shoreline [Resources documentation](https://docs.shoreline.io/platform/resources) for more info.
